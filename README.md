# Humanoid/AGI Skills Concept Map

The **Humanoid/AGI Skills Concept Map** is my attempt at reconstructing all the internal knowledge I've acquired about human skills and artificial general intelligence over the years.

The concept map can have multiple purposes:
* Serve as a refresher
* Find related topics of interest
* Guide newcomers in the domain by exploring topics by their relatedness
* Get an idea of the size of the domain

In order to keep the concept map simple and focused on the topic, the **Humanoid/AGI Skills Concept Map** depends on the [**AGI Concept Map**](https://github.com/tomzx/agi-concept-map).
